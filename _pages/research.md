I have extensively studied multi-decadal variaibility of Indian summer monsoon during my PhD with a primary focus on the atmospheric circulation changes associated with remote oceans. This has led to a couple of publications where I discuss how the Atlantic Ocean variability impacts the Indian monsoon and how the state-of-the-art climate models are able to perform in capturing this connection.

* Monsoon
  
* General circulation of Atmosphere
