I am an early career researcher with primary interest in the large-scale dynamics of the climate system. Currently, I am a postdoc at the University of Birmingham in [Ruth Geen's](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=bVaYx8cAAAAJ&hl=en) group. I am working on the NERC funded BRIDGE project where we are tying to understand the dynamics of regional monsoons. Apart from research, I am interested in learning and making music!
